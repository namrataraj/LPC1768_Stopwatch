# stopwatch

This project focuses on the design of an embedded stopwatch system tailored for the LPC1768 demo board using embedded C programming. The system integrates keyboard input, a timer module, and a LCD display to enable precise time measurement and intuitive user interaction. The key objectives are listed as follows:

1. User-Friendly Interface: The embedded stopwatch system is designed with user convenience in mind, featuring start, stop, and reset functionalities accessible via a simple keyboard interface. This ensures effortless control and enhances the overall user experience.

2. Accurate Time Tracking: Utilizing an intricately configured timer module, the system ensures precise time measurement, crucial for reliable stopwatch operation. Users can trust the system to accurately track elapsed time, whether for sports timing, educational exercises, or industrial processes.

3. Clear Visual Feedback: The integration of a 7-segment display provides clear visual feedback of elapsed time in a recognizable format. This enhances readability and user understanding.

Overall, through the application of embedded C programming techniques, this project showcases efficient design methodologies in creating a versatile stopwatch solution. Whether used for sports timing, educational exercises, or industrial processes, the system offers intuitive interaction, accurate time tracking, and clear visual feedback, catering to diverse user needs with ease.
